      <h2>By Endurance We Conquer</h2>
      <p>
        In 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew of 27 set out aboard the Endurance to complete the Imperal Trans-Antarctic Expedition, the first crossing of the southermost continent. The peril that ensued saw the loss of their ship in the most inhospitable place on Earth. Nearly two years later, all 28 men returned home alive. This is their story.

      <h2>The Endurance Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project seeks to create one of the most thorough repositories of facts relating to the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. This is not a dramatic retelling or engaging narrative, but rather a collection of facts, figures, and information about the expedition and its participants. It is intended to be a resource for those interested in the raw history of the Endurance and the incredible true story of survival against all odds.
